Advent of code using JuliaLang

https://adventofcode.com/2019/about

Python had been by language of choice for a while
however since becoming a semi-regular Julia user,
ive been meaning to practice my Julia-fu more.

May not be the most optimal solutions. As far as possible
iv'e tried to stick to the stdlib, i guess thats the general
idea of these kind of challenges.

Someday i'll get around to writing an explaning/walkthrough blog
for if not all, atleast  the most fun problems ive solved
through the AOC.
